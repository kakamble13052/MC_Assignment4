# MC_Assignment4

This assignment shows Shared Preferences and Database capabilities. 
Tried External Storage but permission was denied. 
Found out app was compiled using API 24. 
Tried requesting permissions, to no effect.
Tried downgrading API, app became unrunnable.

Database - Information.db
Table Name - info
Attributes - Name(**String**), Age(**String**)

Do not try to display data first, App would stop(Null Pointer).
Instead Add Data(if using for the first time)
or Delete Data
